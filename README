A bunch of stuff that I normally like to have around, or that it isn't normal

  TopLJPostPackager.py       - Used at jrbl.org to query my LiveJournal, gather up the most recent public posts, and 
                               stick their permalinks into a file for server-side inclusion.  With minor enhancement,
                               could be used to repackage any RSS or Atom feed.
