A bunch of stuff that I normally like to have around, or that it isn't normal 
for me to have, but which I thought others would find useful.

  TopLJPostPackager.py       - Used at jrbl.org to query my LiveJournal, gather up the most recent public posts, and 
                               stick their permalinks into a file for server-side inclusion.  With minor enhancement,
                               could be used to repackage any RSS or Atom feed.

  BaseChanger.py             - converts integers into string representations in arbitrary bases, and arbitrarily-based
                               strings (encoding numeric values) into regular integers.  Has convenience features for 
                               bases up to base-66, which is the highest base that can be supported in standard URLs.
                               Used whenever I need to generate locally unique identifiers.
